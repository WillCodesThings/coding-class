# Coding

This repository is a collection of coding projects for my middle school coding classes. The 2021-2022 school year will be my second year teaching coding. As I gain more experience coding I plan to piece together various coding projects aimed at beginners. 


Dylan Beattie has an amazing talk [The Art of Code](https://youtu.be/6avJHaC3C2U) that speaks to the creative side of coding. I plan to incorporate a bunch of ideas from this talk in my coding class.
