# Countdown Timer

I recently stumbled across the #100daysofCode campaign. I signed up for the Talk Python course which is a collaboration between the guys from Pybites and Bob. The first set of lessons was all about the datetime module. We were supposed to use the datetime module to create a pomodoro timer that incorporated datetimes as well. Instead, I decided to create a countdown to summer timer. 

The plan is that this will be one of the first projects for next school year. Maybe even team up with the makerspace teacher and create an LED sign that displays the countdown.
