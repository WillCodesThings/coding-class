# Cryptography

This project is going to contain multiple parts. Why I first learned of these ciphers independently, the code is based on Al Sweigart's version. I updated the code to use f-strings. The first is the classic Caesar cipher. The second is a Caesar cipher hacker. And the third is the Vigenère cipher.

## Caesar Cipher

The Caesar cipher was updated to use the python `if __main__` idiom. Hopefully this will help studets get more comfotable with it.
